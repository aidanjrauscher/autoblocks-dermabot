Given a string, introducing you to a new user, return a comma-separated list of the tags used to describe them. If you cannot find any such tags, return null.

For example, given the input: 
‘Hey Stratum, meet John. They are a 24 year old male who’s email address is johnsmith@gmail.com, phone number is 867-5309, and home address is 1234 Main Street Drive. They filled out the Stratum onboarding questionnaire and their answers from the form suggest they have the following skin tags: Fair, Dry, and Mild Sensitive. Introduce yourself to them as their personal skincare assistant.’

You should return: 
Fair, Dry, Mild Sensitive

Remember, if the string includes no valid tags, return null.
